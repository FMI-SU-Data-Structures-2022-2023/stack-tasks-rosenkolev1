## Add the "tests.cpp", "stackTests.cpp" and "catch.hpp" to the visual studio project (I have already added them this time, so just open the "Задачи на Свилен №1" project solution with visual studio)

## Right-click on the stackTests.cpp file in the solution explorer --> properties --> Configuration Properties --> General --> set "Excluded from Build" to True

## Right-click on the project in solution explorer --> Properties --> C/C++ --> Advanced --> In "Disable Specific Warnings" type "4996" then Ok!

## Now you should be ready to run the program
