Opening the solution(.sln) file with Visual Studio should be enough for you to be able to run the program. All the Tasks are in seperate functions and all the Tasks tests are inside the main method. Uncomment and Comment those tests and then run the program to see them carried out.

## On second thought, you might need to also remove the VS warning for not using the VS compiler's "safe" functions as opposed to the standard ones

## Right-click on the project in solution explorer --> Properties --> C/C++ --> Advanced --> In "Disable Specific Warnings" type "4996" then Ok!

## Now you should be ready to run the program
